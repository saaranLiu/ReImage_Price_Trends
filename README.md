# CNN Stock Trend Prediction

> **INFO 5000 (Fall 2025) - Group 7 Final Project**

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for stock price trend prediction based on the paper **"(Re-)Imag(in)ing Price Trends"**. The model converts OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) price data into images and uses CNN to predict future price movements.

## Key Components

### Data Processing (`Data/`)

  * **Image Generation:** Converts OHLC data into visual representations.
  * **Preprocessing:** Data normalization and cleaning.
  * **Dataset Splitting:**
      * Training: 1993-2000
      * Testing: 2001-2019
  * **Window Support:** Handles 5, 20, and 60-day windows.

### Model Architecture (`Model/`)

  * CNN implementation tailored for different input windows.
  * Training and validation procedures.
  * Model ensemble support.
  * Checkpoint management.

### Portfolio Analysis (`Portfolio/`)

  * Portfolio construction based on model predictions.
  * Incorporates transaction costs into analysis.

### Results Analysis (`results/`)

  * Storage for trained models and prediction CSVs.
  * Calculation of performance metrics and portfolio results.
  * See the reports for more details about the results. The results doesnot upload here because of the file size.

## Setup and Installation

**1. Create conda environment:**

```bash
conda env create -f cnn_env.yml
```

**2. Activate environment:**

```bash
conda activate cnn_env
```

## Usage

### Training

Run the training script with defined input and prediction windows:

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py --input_window 5 --predict_window 5
```

### Portfolio Analysis

Analyze portfolio performance for a specific model (e.g., I5R5) over a specific period:

```bash
python Portfolio/analyze_portfolio.py --model I5R5 --start_year 2001 --end_year 2019
```

## Model Configurations

The project uses specific abbreviations for Input (I) and Prediction (R) windows:

| Category | Tag | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Input Window** | `I5` | 5-day historical window |
| | `I20` | 20-day historical window |
| | `I60` | 60-day historical window |
| **Prediction Window** | `R5` | Predict next 5 days |
| | `R20` | Predict next 20 days |
| | `R60` | Predict next 60 days |

### Results Directory Structure

```

## Performance Metrics

The model evaluation includes:

  * Prediction accuracy
  * Return prediction
  * Portfolio performance
  * Risk-adjusted returns

## Dependencies

Main dependencies (see `cnn_env.yml` for the complete list):

  * Python 3.8+
  * PyTorch
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  * scikit-learn

## Notes

  * The model uses **ensemble learning** with multiple CNN instances.
  * Predictions are generated on a **rolling basis**.
  * Portfolio construction explicitly considers **transaction costs**.
  * Results are saved in **CSV format** for further analysis.
